A quick interface to popular jQuery plugins and the jQuery and Javascript packaged with Wordpress.

== Description ==

The Javascript Application Manager (JAM) for Wordpress is a unique new tool for quickly including a wide variety of plugins and libraries for Javascript and jQuery allowing users to load one or many with a simple interface, eliminating the need to alter themes to bring the wonderful user experience. Enjoy your already-favorite Javascript and jQuery plugins and discover new ones with this great tool for themers.

Includes 12 plugins :: Arctext, aSlyder, Avgrund Modal, Countdown, Fittext, Gridster, iCheck, jQuery Knob, Lettering, Tubular and Typeahead.  All included plugins are set up to work with the noConflict style for complete Wordpress compatibility.  More plugins coming soon!

Allows quick and easy adding/removing of 44 of the Javascript, jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery UI Effect plugins and libraries included with Wordpress.  Allows easy theme switching without needing to recode theme files to bring jQuery functionality to the new theme.

This is not a plug-n-play device, but rather a tool for experienced themers to improve workflow in including functionality to themes.  Some setup required for most plugins and libraries.  All plugins included are GPL, MIT or WTFPL licensed so can be redistributed, sold and submitted to Wordpress.org without licensing conflicts.
